\title{Compute Mean Signal per Bin}
\usage{
mean_bin_signal(bins, cov)
}
\arguments{
\item{bins}{A GRanges object representing genomic bins.}

\item{cov}{A named list of coverage objects (Rle) keyed by chromosome.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of the same length as \code{bins}, where each element
is the mean coverage over that bin.
}
\description{
Given a set of genomic bins (GRanges) and a coverage object (list of Rle),
this function computes the mean coverage value for each bin.
