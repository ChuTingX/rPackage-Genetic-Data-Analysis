Description: The 'chuting' package provides functions to compute mean coverage 
    signals for genomic bins and to identify the bin that best correlates with 
    gene expression. By combining coverage data from Rle objects and 
    user-supplied expression values, it enables straightforward exploration of 
    localized epigenomic signals and their relationship to transcriptional activity.
